CustomModalView
===============

This is a sample iPhone project showing one way to display a custom modal view. 

How to Use

Your view controller must inherit from `WPSModalViewController` to display the view as a custom modal view.

Use the `edgeInsets` property on `WPSModalViewController` to control the edge insets for the modal view. The default edge insets is `(8, 8, 8, 8)`.
